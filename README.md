# Global Superstore Analysis

The goal of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard for tracking the sales team's performance within our company and to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales.

## Data Preparation
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process involves handling raw sales data. The raw data is contained within the ETL folder, where a Python script was used to split the given Excel file into three CSV files. These files can be found in the prepared Data folder.
